Image detection use TensorFlow with Keras for the LLM and Streamlit for the UI

- MobileNetV2 is a pre-trained model that comes with Keras (TensorFlow).
- When you specify weights='imagenet', TensorFlow automatically downloads the weights trained on the ImageNet dataset.
- The downloaded weights are usually cached locally on your machine under: ~/.keras/models/
